# Chinese-Stock-Market-Research
This is a research project about Chinese Stock Market, will be continuously maintained until I finish my Master graduate thesis.

Technique used: </br>
Python Programming </br>
Python Web-scraping </br>
SQL Database </br>

Goal:
1. Dataset: create a dataset with abundant stock market information
2. Data analysis: analyze the dataset (general goal)
3. Prediction: predict the stock price (general goal)

Current progress:
Working on a position table for a specific stock id. The table logic is learned from an online course about stock analysis.
Table logic also involves some data that need to be scraped from website, learning web-scraping recently.
Still trying to figure out how to get formatted data from specific data source.

* Suppose the most useful part is MACD calculation. I found that the Chinese stock MACD calculation result is different from foreign stocks.
